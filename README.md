# Bankist - Banking App for minmalists

A page with information about modern minimalist bank

This project is a part of [The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by `Jonas Schmedtmann`.
The design and structure were provided as part of the course curriculum, and I did not design the website from scratch. The primary purpose of this project is to practice and apply the concepts learned during the course.

## The following topics were used in this "Bankist" App:

- Selecting, creating elements;
- Implementing smooth scrolling;
- Event Propagation, Event Delegation;
- Building a tabbed component;
- Implementing a sticky navigation;
- The IntercectionObserver API;
- Lazy Loading Images;
- Building a slider component;

(without responsive design)
